# AIML Models for Logistics Vulnerability, Prioritization and Recovery Prediction

## Problem Statement
Global trade and logistics systems face frequent disruptions due to natural disasters,
traffic congestion, mechanical failures, and geopolitical events.
Traditional systems react after disruptions occur, leading to increased costs
and customer dissatisfaction.

## Objective
To build an AIML-based prototype that:
- Identifies vulnerable logistics routes or shipments
- Prioritizes critical disruptions
- Predicts recovery likelihood or delay duration

## Solution Overview
This prototype demonstrates a machine learning workflow that uses logistics-related
features such as delay time, disruption severity, and route importance to predict
recovery outcomes and support proactive decision-making.

## Technology Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Project Type
Academic prototype for demonstrating AIML-based prioritization and recovery prediction
in logistics systems.
